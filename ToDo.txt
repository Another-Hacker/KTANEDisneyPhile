GUI:
1. Picker for Disney Shows (Movies/TV...)
2. Picker for Disney Songs (from^)
3. Submit button

Logic:
1. Get digital root of SN converting letters to nums(%10)
2. Match num to Table A
3. Bats and Ports (moving through Table A)
    a. If bat >= 2 AND port types >= 2
        ANS: is NOT op2
             is (op1 OR op3) AND first letter is even
    b. If bat < 2 AND port types < 2 
        ANS: is NOT op2
             is (op1 OR op3) AND first letter is odd
    c. If (bat >= 2 AND port types >= 2) AND (bat == totalPorts)
        ANS: is op2 in next index
             is op2 in index 0 if IndexOutOfRange
    d. If (bat < 2 AND port types < 2) AND (bat == totalPorts)
        ANS: is op2 in prior index
             is op2 in index last if IndexOutOfRange
    e. If bat >= 2 AND port types < 2 
        ANS: is op2 index above
             is op2 index last(row) if IndexOutOfRange
    f. If  bat < 2 AND port types >= 2
        ANS: is op2 in index below
             is op2 in index first(row) if IndexOutOfRange
    g. OTHERWISE
        ANS: is op2 in index

To solve match TableA_ANS to related movie in Table B


Table A Format = {{{a,b,c},{a,b,c},{a,b,c},...},{{d,e,f},{d,e,f},{d,e,f},...},...}
